PS2_Chrome_Extension
====================

An in-house website that was designed several years ago has begun showing its age. 
This extension imporves the user experience on the portal.

The main page of the web application contains a table with a list of about 400 links. Each link opens
in a new page and contains more details about each entry. This extension crawls through the table, gets
the links, fetches the data for each link and populates a table with this data.

The extension also has the ability to export this data into an Excel sheet using DataTables jquery plugin.
